## The Structure of this book
We assume that the readers want to:

* know what the correct terms in Digital Reality are in general.
* be familiar with the current technological improvements in different profession
* know how these technologies may help to teach skills.
* know new trends in education connected to DR technologies.
* know conditions, requirements, advantages, and potential hazards of investing in DR solutions.
* know the costs and savings generated by DR solutions.

The structure of the book is to be built up according to these needs. The book will be divided into four parts: Getting started, DR in VET, Teaching Guidelines, and Instructor 2.0. Every part of the book, however, should stand alone so the readers should be able to begin in the middle of the book if they want.  

# Authentication

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')

```

```javascript

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
