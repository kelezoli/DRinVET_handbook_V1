Reference-style: 
![alt text][logo]
The book assumes that you have at least a passing familiarity with Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. The readers may have heard the terms or seen someone trying out a VR experience at a mall or retailer or had the chance to try out a headset. 
We assume also, that the readers have some educational background. They work for public or private vocational schools and have some experience in teaching skills.
The book also assumes that the readers have an open mind regarding these technologies and are curious about where they are headed in the future. They want to improve and be updated with the recent pedagogical approaches in vocational education.
 (approximately half standard word document page)
## The Structure of this book
We assume that the readers want to:

* know what the correct terms in Digital Reality are in general
* be familiar with the current technological improvements in different profession
* know how these technologies may help to teach skills
* know new trends in education connected to DR technologies
* know conditions, requirements, advantages, and potential hazards of investing in DR solutions
* know the costs and savings generated by DR solutions

The structure of the book is to be built up according to these needs. The book will be divided into four parts: Getting started, DR in VET, Teaching Guidelines, and Instructor 2.0. Every part of the book, however, should stand alone so the readers should be able to begin in the middle of the book if they want.

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby

require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>
